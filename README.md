# Quick Search

Quick Search is a lightweight, keyboard-driven Firefox browser extension that lets you search, open, and manage websites instantly from a popup.

It is designed for speed, minimalism, and privacy — no tracking, no analytics, no external services.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Key |
|------|----|
| Open launcher | `Ctrl + Shift + Q` (configurable) |
| Open first result | `Enter` |
| Open site by shortcut | Assigned key (popup only) |

> Note: Shortcut keys work **inside the popup only**, due to browser security restrictions.

## Edit Mode

When **Edit Mode** is enabled:
- Clicking a site loads it into the editor
- You can modify:
  - Name
  - URL
  - Shortcut key (optional)
- Delete removes the site permanently

Shortcut keys are validated to prevent duplicates.

## Dark Mode

- Automatically follows system/browser theme by default
- Manual toggle available in the popup
- Preference is saved locally

---

## Privacy

Quick Search does **not**:
- Collect personal data
- Collect technical data
- Track user behavior
- Communicate with external servers

All configuration is stored locally using the browser storage API.
